## Homework 7

**Use data from the nwslR package for this homework**

```{r}
## data from https://github.com/adror1/nwslR
# to insall, run devtools::install_github("adror1/nwslR")
library(nwslR)
data("fieldplayer_overall_season_stats")
```


1. Visualize the distribution of assists (`ast`) across players for the 2019 season (your choice on geom)
2. Write a regression equation where position, and matches played (`mp`) are predictors.
3. Estimate this model with a Normal likelihood (OLS)
4. Estimate this model with a Poisson likelihood (family = "poisson")
5. Generate expected values for each position for both models
6. Visualize and interpret your results. Note differences in the OLS and Poisson model results. 
7. Now generate *predicted* values for each position for both models
8. Visualize and interpret your results. Note differences in the OLS and Poisson model results.
