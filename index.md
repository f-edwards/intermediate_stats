## Course description

This is the course syllabus for Intermediate Statistics, Spring 2025. Continuous outcomes that meet the assumptions of ordinary least squares regression are relatively rare in the social sciences. This course focuses our attention on how to estimate regression models for discrete outcomes including binary and count variables. These flexible tools allow us to more accurately model a wide range of outcomes.

We also introduce Bayesian inference as an alternative to frequentist inference and practice simulation as a core practice for statistical research. The class ends with discussions of multilevel models and multiple imputation for missing data. 

## Communication

All course communication will occur over Slack. Check it routinely. 

## Course goals

1. Master data analysis with linear and generalized linear regression models
2. Develop expertise in advanced statistical programming and data visualization 
3. Develop the ability to design and conduct quantitative research
4. Improve your ability to work in teams to conduct research

## Expectations

- Come prepared. This is a relatively small and advanced course. I expect everyone to participate actively.

- Be respectful and professional. Be mindful of the space you take up in the classroom.

- Collaborate with your colleagues. I encourage you all to work together to complete assignments. However, I do expect you each to submit your own homework writeups. 

## Prerequisites

A prior graduate-level course in statistics is required. This course assumes students are comfortable with multivariate linear regression, basic probability, and statistical computing.

### Review resources

These [math camp](https://github.com/math-camp/course) materials from UChicago neatly cover the math you need for graduate-level statistics courses.

Khan Academy's courses in calculus, statistics, and [probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library) are great reviews for the course. 

Jenny Bryan's [STAT 545](http://stat545.com/) course at UBC provides a very comprehensive overview of programming in R and efficient data science workflows.

Rohan Alexander's [Telling Stories with Data](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/) provides a great introduction to practical data analysis with R. 

## Software

All instruction will be conducted in the R statistical programming language. R is free and open-source, and can be downloaded [here](https://cran.r-project.org/).

We will be using the [RStudio integrated development environment](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). RStudio provides a powerful text editor and a range of very useful utilities. 

In addition to writing code, it is a great tool for writing reports, papers, and slides using [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html). This syllabus, most of my course materials, and most of my academic papers are based on Markdown. All course assignments should be completed in RMarkdown.

## Book (required)

Gelman, Hill and Vehtari, *Regression and other stories*. You may either purchase the book, or access it via free pdf [here](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/ROS.pdf)

## Books (recommended)

These recommended books are very useful, and some examples are pulled from them:

Wickham, [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) 

Healy, [*Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction*](http://socviz.co/index.html) 

McElreath, *Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan*

## Assignments and grading

Course grading is based on a combination of homework assignments (50 percent) and a final project (50 percent)

### Homework

All assignments will be posted on the course website. Homeworks should be completed in RMarkdown. Submit both your compiled html file and source code.

- Problem sets: I will assign weekly homework. Assignments are due each Monday before class. 

- All students get 2 no-questions-asked extensions for homework. Just let me know before the due date if you are using one. 

- Research project: You will write or revise a quantitative paper as a final paper. This can be either collaborative or individual.
