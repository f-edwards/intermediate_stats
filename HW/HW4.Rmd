Use the gapminder data -- library(gapminder) -- for this question

1. Create an annual global measure of GDP Per Capita using group_by and summarize
2. Attach this new measure to the gapminder data
3. Create a measure that is equal to the ratio of a country-year's GDP per capita to this global average.
4. Visualize the how this ratio of national GDP to global GDP variable varies across continents and over time. You may need to summarize the data first.
